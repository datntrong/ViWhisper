Unlike many of its predecessors, such as\n[Wav2Vec 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477), which are pre-trained\non un-labelled audio data, Whisper is pre-trained on a vast quantity of\n**labelled** audio-transcription data, 680,000 hours to be precise.\nThis is an order of magnitude more data than the un-labelled audio data used\nto train Wav2Vec 2.0 (60,000 hours). What is more, 117,000 hours of this\npre-training data is multilingual ASR data. This results in checkpoints\nthat can be applied to over 96 languages, many of which are considered\n_low-resource_.\n\nWhen scaled to 680,000 hours of labelled pre-training data, Whisper models\ndemonstrate a strong ability to generalise to many datasets and domains.\nThe pre-trained checkpoints achieve competitive results to state-of-the-art\nASR systems, with near 3% word error rate (WER) on the test-clean subset of\nLibriSpeech ASR and a new state-of-the-art on TED-LIUM with 4.7% WER (_c.f._\nTable 8 of the [Whisper paper](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/whisper.pdf)).\nThe extensive multilingual ASR knowledge acquired by Whisper during pre-training\ncan be leveraged for other low-resource languages; through fine-tuning, the\npre-trained checkpoints can be adapted for specific datasets and languages\nto further improve upon these results.
